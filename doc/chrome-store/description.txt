* For details, refer to User Guide: https://github.com/CharltonC/chrome-custom-code-injector/tree/master/doc/userguide/README.md
* For optimisation, javascript/css code can be optimised prior to be pasted in the code area.
* The editor in the extension is not intended to be a full blown proper code editor. Instead it should be treated as just a pasteboard to store the code. For best editing experience, a proper code editor should be used.
